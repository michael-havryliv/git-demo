i`m sitting here in a boring room
it`s just another rainy Sunday afternoon
i`m wasting my time i`ve got nothing to do
i`m hanging around and i`m waiting for you
but nothing really happens
And i wonder
i wonder how
i wonder why
yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
and all that i can see is just a yellow lemon tree
